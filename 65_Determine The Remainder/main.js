// Question 65: Determine the Remainder: Make a function that gets two numbers and shows the leftover
// from dividing them using the % sign. For example, remainder(5, 2) should give 1.?
// Explain & TIP: The % (modulus) operator finds what's left after one number is divided by another.
// It's handy for figuring out if numbers are even, odd, and more.
// Answer 65:
function num(num1, num2) {
    console.log("Remainder:", num1 % num2);
}
;
num(5, 2);
