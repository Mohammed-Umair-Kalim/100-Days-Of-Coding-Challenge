// Question 79: Creating and Accessing Object Properties: Construct an object representing a car with properties
// for make, model, and year. Then, show how you can access the model property of the car ?

// Explain & TIP: Objects are collections of properties, kind of like a box for storing related information.
// You can create an object to group related data and access its properties using either dot notation or bracket
// notation.

// Answer 79:
let car = {
    make: "Toyota",
    model:"Indus",
    year: 2018
}
// Accessing Car Object properties:
console.log(car.model)
console.log(car.year)
console.log(car.make)
